## How to edit this site

### Obtain write permission to the repo

First, you must have write access to <https://github.com/uhm-descartes/uhm-descartes.github.io>. 

A quick way to see whether you have write access is to check whether or not there is a "pencil icon" in the upper right corner of the [README.md](https://github.com/uhm-descartes/uhm-descartes.github.io/blob/master/README.md) file. If you don't see a pencil, contact Prasad or Philip with your github username and one of them will provide you with permissions.

### Set up your gitpod.io workspace

The simplest way to edit this site is by using <https://gitpod.io>:
