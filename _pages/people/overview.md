Project Descartes is comprised of a diverse and overlapping group of stakeholders. 

Our [leadership team](./leadership-team.md) includes the principal investigators and cooperating faculty who set the direction for the research and training opportunities provided to our students.

Our [students](./students.md) are the ultimate focus and goal of the program. 

Our [community partners](./community-partners.md) provide project ideas and internship opportunities for our students, and career connections for our graduates.

Our [advisory board](./advisory-board.md) provides oversight and guidance to the leadership team and helps ensure that our directions align with workforce needs and the best interests of our students. 

Our [gallery of NRT participants](http://descartes.manoa.hawaii.edu/nrt-portfolios/) highlights portfolios of our NRT community members:
