We are currently reaching out to community organizations to support Project Descartes.

Our goal for community partners is to provide a source of useful, real-world organizational projects and networking opportunities for our students.

If you are interested in exploring the idea of becoming a community partner for this project, please contact us at <uhmnrt@hawaii.edu>.
