## Why NRT?

UHM DESCARTES is a interdisciplinary program at the University of
Hawaii (UH) at Manoa, currently funded by a 3 million dollar grant
from the National Science Foundation.  Students will participate in a
research and training model that cuts across traditional departmental
boundaries: including engineering, computer science, business,
economics, medicine, and more.  Concurrently, students will undergo
rigorous training in **data science and artificial intelligence
(AI)**. Our research thrusts in areas of priority to Hawaii:
decarbonization, healthcare and communication, dictate a wealth of
convergent, timely opportunities and challenges that modern data
science and AI can address. Our trainees will be cognizant of not just
technical details of data science and AI, but also address how it can
be properly harnessed towards policy and societal goals.

We welcome both Masters and PhD students to be NRT trainees. Trainees
will typically be coadvised by multiple faculty (usually different
departments), and will address novel interdisciplinary research
challenges.  At the same time, they will participate in our
traineeship model, that includes novel mentoring, collaboration and
dissemination opportunities in addition to courses. Trainees can also
expect to be matched with our industry partners, both in Hawaii and
on the mainland.

A subset of trainees will receive a NRT fellowship (~$34K/year) and
have the tuition paid by the program for one or two years, and will
then be funded as GAs for the rest of their degree period. Direct
fellowships are limited to US persons (citizens/permanent residents).
Other trainees will be supported by other funding sources.

For more details of our program, please visit [the About page](../about.md).
