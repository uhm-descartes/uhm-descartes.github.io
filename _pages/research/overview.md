We propose novel takes on __online and distributed learning__ with
applications to __decarbonization__, __healthcare__ and
__communications__. This convergent research program hews together
engineering, computer science, social science and medicine, and is
dictated by pressing needs of Hawaii as well as challenging problems
in AI and data science. An unique aspect of our work in these areas is
the presence of _dynamic data, often incomplete_, from distributed
sources.

We therefore advance [fundamental research](./fundamental.md) in
online, real-time learning, distributed and federated learning setups,
as well as principled ways to synthesize domain expertise. This
fundamental research is used to juxtapose engineering and AI in the
context of economic and social considerations in

* [Decarbonization](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/research/decarbonization/), focusing on the energy and transportation sectors,
particularly relevant to Hawaii with its high penetration of
renewables and associated challenges. Hawaii is already a leading
state in clean energy integration, and has a target to become
carbon neutral by 2045.


* [Healthcare](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/research/healthcare) On
the one hand, Hawaii has the nation's highest life expectancy, and on
the other, has significant issues in access to healthcare among the Native
Hawaiian population. Our research will help in advancing healthcare in
the islands and beyond.

* [Communications, Networks and Security](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/research/communications), a central tenet of a
sustainable economy in Hawaii, made essential by its geographical
isolation.
