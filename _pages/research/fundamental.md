We propose novel takes on __online and distributed learning__ with
applications to __power grids__, __transportation__, __healthcare__ and
__communications__. This convergent research program hews together
engineering, computer science, social science and medicine, and is
dictated by pressing needs of Hawaii as well as challenging problems
in AI and data science. An unique aspect of our work in these areas is
the presence of _dynamic data, often incomplete_, from distributed
sources. We therefore advance

* online learning in dynamic environments, using our novel framework that tunes stability
and adaptability of learned models via regularization; and which
extends to risk management, adapting hyperparameters in a principled
way and has resolved a number of open problems in online
classification and hypothesis testing thus far, and

* distributed and federated learning, where we propose a kernel based,
adaptable learning framework.

Armed with these approaches, we develop a deeper understanding of
inference and decision making that combines information from learned
models with physical domain knowledge and other constraints, be it
economic or social.  Specifically, we build on

* reinforcement learning exploiting imperfect model side information
* learning in semi-supervised setups with online kernel signal processing approaches,
* anomaly detection and hyperparameter adaptation using Minimum Description Length (MDL) like approaches, and
* causality in economics experiment design informed by machine
learning best practices.

This fundamental research is used to juxtapose engineering and AI in
the context of economic and social considerations in

* [Decarbonization](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/research/decarbonization/), particularly focusing on the smart energy and transportation sectors.
Hawaii has one of the highest electricity rates in the country, and its energy status is fragile because of its geographical isolation. Yet, it has very high solar potential, showing a technically challenging, but reliable route towards energy independence. Building on UH Manoa research,
we take advantage of collaborations with local stakeholders and
utilities for granular and high-frequency electricity usage and
transportation data; and the UHM campus, which has come to be a
natural living lab to collect data and conduct experiments. We adapt
our online learning framework to produce adaptable, faster response
machine learning predictors in real systems. We investigate targeting
policies to the right groups using a combination of tools we have
developed, as well as behavioral explorations in the transportation
sector, particularly with EVs, to improve integration with the power grid and also reducing emissions. Hawaii is already a leading
state in integrating decentralized power generation, and we expect our work to provide
insights on how to enhance new energy technologies in the nation and beyond.

* [Healthcare](https://uhm-descartes.github.io/research/healthcare), particularly disease detection from ECGs and epidemics modeling, leveraging
perhaps the largest pediatric ECG dataset (collected and curated by
one of the PIs).  Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are affected
by heart diseases at a higher rate, and the unique isolated geography of Hawaii
meant that pandemic dynamics, such as the spread of COVID-19 differed
from how diseases would spread on the mainland. Here again we combine
domain knowledge and incomplete, possibly biased measurements within
our broader framework of anomaly detection using generative approaches.

* [Communications, Networks and Security](../research/wireless.md), a central tenet of a
sustainable economy in Hawaii, made essential by its geographical
isolation. Our work focuses on creating NextG wireless systems with
enhanced communication, novel sensing, attack resiliency and energy
efficiency. With the evolution of cellular systems to mmWave and
sub-THz bands, we focus on sensing solutions using mobile
communications as a sensor, for which we develop algorithms that
leverage the spatial diversity of a multiple antenna systems and
frequency diversity of a wideband antenna systems; innovative wireless
physical layer security using reconfigurable devices; and tackling
coverage issues in the mmWave band using intelligent reflecting
surfaces (large number of low cost reflecting elements with
reconfigurable parameters).
