title: "Research: Decarbonization"


excerpt: >

This project integrates data science and machine learning into engineering and social science frameworks to address challenges in creating low-carbon power systems with large shares of renewable energy sources.  
 
Research includes dynamic electricity pricing based on supply and demand; reinforcement learning to control home appliances; federated learning at the grid edge for enhanced security and privacy; and policies to implement equitable energy transition and assist low-income households in adopting decarbonization technology, where machine learning is instrumental. 

Hawai\`i has high penetration of renewable energy and an exceptionally high share of households with rooftop solar systems in the United States. Thus Hawai\`i  and the UHM campus form a natural `living laboratory' to conduct experiments to evaluate and validate the research.
