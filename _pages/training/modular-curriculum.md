DESCARTES utilizes modular curricula to enable interdisplinary training and education in data science. Studets develop a customized training by working though modules selected from the DESCARTS module repository.

We have a growing list of courses that adopt the modular design across various departments. For details, check out the [DESCARTES Course Sites](https://descartes.manoa.hawaii.edu/descartes-modules/course-sites/).
