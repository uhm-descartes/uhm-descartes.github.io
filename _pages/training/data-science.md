DESCARTES Data Science training is motivated by national and Hawai‘i needs and
the increasing diversity of careers for graduate students across
various disciplines, including engineering, social sciences and
computer science. Students conducting research in data science from
engineering and computer science increasingly find that they enter
jobs that require knowledge of economics, business, finance, public
policy, and other social science disciplines. At the same time
students conducting research in data science from social science
increasingly find that they enter jobs that require knowledge of
mathematical and quantitative approaches and understanding of
engineering problems.

To accommodate students from different backgrounds and train them for
the diverse careers in data science, students will obtain a [T-shaped
background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) with breadth and depth in data science. Students from an
engineering, social science, or computer science background and will
obtain breadth through taking core courses outside their disciplines
and through a finer-grained approach to course structures through
DESCARTES modules. Breadth will
also be obtained through engagement in research through their cohort
group, mentoring, presentations, and workshops. Students will obtain
depth by taking follow-up courses (primarily in their department) to
prepare them for their research.

## Multidisciplinary Data Science Education and Training

The program’s main objective is to develop a convergent education and research program to train students for industry
and academic careers. Students are engaged in a novel education program to obtain a broad,
engaged, and enhanced series of learning experiences:

- NRT students have access to the **training module framework** where the pedagogical focus shifts from the coarse granularity of
courses to a finer level of modules, with each module containing approximately 1-2 weeks of teaching content.

- NRT students build a **portfolio of work** to give a record of their education and research progress providing multimedia
content (videos, posters, articles, software, data). A portfolio documents progress through
the NRT program and is made available to NRT participants including industry.

- Students participate in a **vertically-integrated mentor process**. NRT students will help teach fundamentals
and applications of data science to beginning graduate and undergraduate students. This provides a valuable form of
professional development in teaching, communication, and leadership skills for future research and educational careers.

- Students participate in **multidisciplinary collaborative efforts** through research cohorts, shared online class
materials, and extensive outreach. Students will interact with our external constituents (industry, K-12 students) through
internships, outreach, mentoring activities, and giving public presentations that will enhance professional development.

- **Summer Training and Orientation**: New NRT students will come from diverse backgrounds ranging from
Engineering to Economics to Business to Mathematics/ Statistics to Natural Sciences, with different backgrounds
and expectations with AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning. A weekend orientation program at the beginning
of the school year will train new NRT students about our curriculum approach using modules and the Knowledge
Map. The training will be by returning NRT students, faculty, and industry constituents. Featured with the orientation
program there will be a focused one week course on Data Science and Machine Learning basics for students who are
completely new to the area or want a refresher course. This will include illustrations of Machine Learning applications
in Engineering. The class will be coordinated by an NRT investigator, but taught by returning NRT students.

- **Workshops**: Each semester will focus on a specific research area where an NRT investigator will coordinate a seminar
series in the area. We will also hold mini-workshops involving NRT investigators and external researchers. In addition,
over each winter break, we will organize a 2-day workshop among all NRT students and faculty, the EAC, and the NRT
evaluator to engage with the external community. The workshop will feature keynote talks from distinguished speakers
from industry and academia, panels led by NRT investigators featuring key research and educational developments,
a student poster session for their research, and a meeting among the EAC and the NRT investigators.

- NRT students will participate in **faculty directed data science research projects** and **local industry and business consulting**.
