## Interdisciplinary pathways to applied data science addressing critical challenges of climate change, health epidemics, data security, and societal injustice with data, facts, and truth.



# Overview
There has been an explosion of growth in using AI, data science, and machine learning in
all aspects of our daily life. There is a global competition among governments, industry, and academic
institutions to lead the research and development in this area. The competition has accelerated as knowledge
gained in the area can assist in addressing the growing current pressing threats to our society including
climate change, health epidemics, data security, and societal injustice. At the University of Hawai‘i at Manoa
(UHM) our NRT-AI project on Data in Engineering and Society: Converging Applications, Research, and
Training Enhancements for Students (NRT-DESCARTES) focuses on the research and educational strengths
of the faculty while considering problems that are critical to the US; engineering infrastructure systems that
play important roles in society. The project will support 15 M.S. students and 14 Ph.D. students in this NRT
project with a total of 41 student years of support being provided. In addition we will recruit an additional
10 M.S. students and 10 Ph.D. students that will be supported with other research and teaching funds that
will be part of the NRT program for a total of 49 students that will participate in the NRT project.

# Introduction
Data Science training is motivated by national and Hawai‘i needs and the increasing diversity of careers for
graduate students across various disciplines, including engineering, social sciences and computer science. Students
conducting research in data science from engineering and computer science increasingly find that they enter jobs
that require knowledge of economics, business, finance, public policy, and other social science disciplines. At the
same time students conducting research in data science from social science increasingly find that they enter jobs that
require knowledge of mathematical and quantitative approaches and understanding of engineering problems.

To accommodate NRT students from different backgrounds and train them for the diverse careers in data science,
we will require each student to obtain a T-shaped background with breadth and depth in data science. Students will
come from an engineering, social science, or computer science background and will obtain breadth through taking
core courses outside their disciplines and through a finer-grained approach to course structures through modules.
Breadth will also be obtained through engagement in research through their cohort group, mentoring, presentations, and
workshops. Students will obtain depth by taking follow-up courses (primarily in their department) to prepare them for their research. The NRT-DESCARTES program will have M.S. and Ph.D students obtaining degrees in their respective
department and students will also work towards a graduate data science certificate that will be developed at UHM.
This Section explains the content,the implementation, and products of the NRT program.

# Multidisciplinary Data Science Education and Training
The program’s main objective is to develop a convergent education and research program to train students for industry
and academic careers. The program will have students engaged in a novel education program to obtain a broad,
engaged, and enhanced series of learning experiences.

## Building a sustainable data science program
The process of going from a traditional data science program to an NRT program with curriculum based mainly on
modules with a GDSC will be evolutionary. To assist in this process we will have two working groups; a module
working group and a knowledge map working group. Using the Morea framework and the assistance of our external
evaluator, Lee we will consistently evaluate and assess modules and progress of the NRT program.
The module working group will initially be led by Johnson, who started Morea and has modularized courses
in the ICS department. The working group will also consist of other faculty and at least one NRT student. This
working group will assist faculty and students in developing and understanding the basic principles of modules and
implementing Morea. The working group will also get feedback from faculty and students on how the implementation
of Morea and modules is working with the goal of making improvements based on experiences by understanding
successes and areas that need improvement.

The knowledge map working group will initially be led by Santhanam, who has played a key role in development of
the knowledge map as an information database describing modules and the relationship between modules. The working
group will also include other faculty, at least one NRT student, and our administrative assistant. This working group
will develop the online knowledge map and assist faculty and students for using and understanding how the knowledge
map works. This working group will also get feedback from faculty and students at ways of adding to the knowledge
map and making improvements to it. Both working groups will evolve with rotating leadership and membership.
The education and research will be evaluated by our external evaluator, Lee and our advisory board as discussed
in other sections. The goal is to improve NRT-DESCARTES each year from our experiences and feedback we receive.
In the first year we will modularize a few courses in different disciplines and create an enhanced learning experience.
By the end of five years we will have a sustained NRT data science program with students obtaining a comprehensive
multidisciplinary data science education with breadth and depth in a variety of areas to prepare them to enter the
workforce in academic and industry jobs. We envision that the program could be adopted by other UHM programs
and spread to other academic institutions outside Hawai‘i. Possibilities


3.d.1 Multidisciplinary Data Science Education and Training
The program’s main objective is to develop a convergent education and research program to train students for industry
and academic careers. The program will have students engaged in a novel education program to obtain a broad,
engaged, and enhanced series of learning experiences.
3.d.1.a) Highlights of our approach
• Enabling our vision is a module framework where the pedagogical focus shifts from the coarse granularity of
courses to a finer level of modules, with each module containing approximately 1-2 weeks of teaching content. The
modules are implemented using the Morea system [4], developed at UHM by Johnson in 2015 as an alternative to
traditional learning management systems that do not provide “first class” status to pedagogical elements including
Modules, Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments. Morea provides strategic benefits to both faculty
and students: for faculty, a framework that supports collaborative development of structured curriculum content; for
students, wider access and information to curriculum. Through module dependencies, sharing of curriculum, and
a Knowledge Map students will benefit from a greater variety of courses outside their home department.
• The NRT students will have an engaged and enhanced learning experience. The community of practice (CoP)
[5], consisting of faculty, students, and staff, will accomplish this. Key attributes include:
- The students will be fully engaged by building portfolios of their work in addition to their thesis. The portfolios will
give a record of the student’s education and research progress through NRT-DESCARTES by providing multimedia
content (videos, posters, articles, software, data). The portfolios require students to think about their progress through
the NRT program (see NIH encourages development plans [7]), will be made available to NRT participants including
industry from EAC, and evaluated (see Section 3i) with feedback given to students.
- NRT-DESCARTES employs a vertically-integrated mentor process. NRT students will help teach fundamentals
and applications of data science to beginning graduate and undergraduate students. This provides a valuable form of
professional development in teaching, communication, and leadership skills for future research and educational careers.
- NRT-DESCARTES will foster multidisciplinary collaborative efforts through research cohorts, shared online class
materials, and extensive outreach. Students will interact with our external constituents (industry, K-12 students) through
internships, outreach, mentoring activities, and giving public presentations that will enhance professional development.

3.d.1b) Curriculum structure and Morea framework
NRT-DESCARTES develops a multidisciplinary data science curriculum. Currently at UHM, many data science,
machine learning, and related courses exist in different departments. We anticipate NRT-DESCARTES will also
develop one to two new courses each year. A key question is how do we go from these courses to a multidisciplinary
and integrated data science education program? NRS-DESCARTES accomplishes this by applying the Morea
framework [4] for several courses across several departments.
A well-designed module framework will enhance the courses. A module is a portion of a course, focused typically
on one topic and covering between a week or two of regular coursework. Morea will host the material for the modules—
lecture videos, readings, associated programming material, and assessment instruments. Every module will have a
host department and instructors that manage their content, see Section 3d2.for courses we are planning to modularize.
Our proposal framework provides a way to add, enhance, curate and prune modules in a data derived fashion. This
provides strategic advantages in terms of flexibility, organization, and efficiency:
• Modules would have their prerequisites in terms of other modules, thus easing the burden of prerequisites across
different department boundaries.
• All modules will be shared across all departments, reducing duplication of content. Students will have access to
all modules from the beginning and use the Knowledge Map to visualize module relationships.


• Summer Training and Orientation New NRT students will come from diverse backgrounds ranging from
Engineering to Economics to Business to Mathematics/ Statistics to Natural Sciences, with different backgrounds
and expectations with AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning. A weekend orientation program at the beginning
of the school year will train new NRT students about our curriculum approach using modules and the Knowledge
Map. The trainng will be by returning NRT students, faculty, and industry constituents. Featured with the orientation
program there will be a focused one week course on Data Science and Machine Learning basics for students who are
completely new to the area or want a refresher course. This will include illustrations of Machine Learning applications
in Engineering. The class will be coordinated by an NRT investigator, but taught by returning NRT students.

• Workshops Each semester will focus on a specific research area where an NRT investigator will coordinate a seminar
series in the area. We will also hold mini-workshops involving NRT investigators and external researchers. In addition,
over each winter break, we will organize a 2-day workshop among all NRT students and faculty, the EAC, and the NRT
evaluator to engage with the external community. The workshop will feature keynote talks from distinguished speakers
from industry and academia, panels led by NRT investigators featuring key research and educational developments,
a student poster session for their research, and a meeting among the EAC and the NRT investigators.
