Today’s faculty meeting reminded us how data science can be a tool for justice.

We had the pleasure of welcoming Dr. Treena S. Becker, Assistant Research Professor who shared her emerging research: Using Machine Learning to Predict Features Within the Substance Use Disorder Treatment Continuum of Care that Increase the Likelihood of Positive Treatment Outcomes.

Her team is applying AI and Machine Learning, specifically Random Forest models, to uncover the most effective and cost-efficient treatment strategies, aftercare services, and environmental factors (like housing and employment) that support recovery and reduce relapse.

She also introduced opportunities for DESCARTES trainees to collaborate on this transformative project, engaging in real-world data analysis across TEDS, N-SSATS, and ASUS datasets—working at the intersection of technology, health equity, and social impact.

Mahalo, Dr. Becker, for sharing your research with us.
